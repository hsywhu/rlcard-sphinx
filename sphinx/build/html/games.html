<h2>Blackjack<a class="headerlink" href="#blackjack" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Blackjack is a globally popular banking game known as Twenty-One. The
objective is to beat the dealer by reaching a higher score than the
dealer without exceeding 21. In the toolkit, we implement a simple
version of Blackjack. In each round, the player only has two options:
“hit” which will take a card, and ‘stand’ which end the turn. The player
will “bust” if his hands exceed 21 points. After the player completes
his hands (chooses “stand” and has not busted), the dealer then reals
his hidden card and “hit” until obtaining at least 17 points.</p>

<h2>Leduc Hold’em<a class="headerlink" href="#leduc-hold-em" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Leduc Hold’em is a smaller version of Limit Texas Hold’em (first
introduced in <a class="reference external" href="http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/publications/UAI05.pdf">Bayes’ Bluff: Opponent Modeling in
Poker</a>). The deck
consists only two pairs of King, Queen and Jack, six cards in total.
Each game is fixed with two players, two rounds, two-bet maximum and
raise amounts of 2 and 4 in the first and second round. In the first
round, each player puts 1 unit in the pot and is dealt one card, then
starts betting. In the second round, one public card is revealed first,
then the players bet again. Finally, the player whose hand has the same
rank as the public card is the winner. If neither, then the one with
higher rank wins. Other rules such as ‘fold’ can refer to Limit Texas
hold’em.</p>

<p>Texas Hold’em is a popular betting game. Each player is dealt two
face-down cards, called hole cards. Then 5 community cards are dealt in
three stages (the flop, the turn and the river). Each player seeks the
five best cards among the hole cards and community cards. There are 4
betting rounds. During each round each player can choose “call”,
“check”, “raise”, or “fold”.</p>

of raise. And in each round the number of raises is limited to 4.</p>

<p>The stardard unit used in the leterature is milli big blinds per hand
(mbb/h). In the toolkit, the reward is calculated based on big blinds
per hand. For example, a reward of 0.5 (-0.5) means that the player wins
(loses) 0.5 times of the amount of big blind.</p>

<h2>Dou Dizhu<a class="headerlink" href="#dou-dizhu" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Doudizhu is one of the most popular Chinese card games with hundreds of
millions of players. It is played by three people with one pack of 54
cards including a red joker and a black joker. After bidding, one player
would be the “landlord” who can get an extra three cards, and the other
two would be “peasants” who work together to fight against the landlord.
In each round of the game, the starting player must play a card or a
combination, and the other two players can decide whether to follow or
“pass.” A round is finished if two consecutive players choose “pass.”
The player who played the cards with the highest rank will be the first
to play in the next round. The objective of the game is to be the first
player to get rid of all the cards in hand. For detailed rules, please
refer to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou_dizhu">Wikipedia</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%96%97%E5%9C%B0%E4%B8%BB/177997?fr=aladdin">Baike</a>.</p>
<p>In the toolkit, we implement a standard version of Doudizhu. In the
bidding phase, we heuristically designate one of the players as the
“landlord.” Specifically, we count the number of key cards or
combinations (high-rank cards and bombs), and the player with the most
powerful hand is chosen as “lanlord.”</p>

<h3>State Representation of Dou Dizhu<a class="headerlink" href="#state-representation-of-dou-dizhu" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>At each decision point of the game, the corresponding player will be
able to observe the current state (or information set in imperfect
information game). The state consists of all the information that the
player can observe from his view. We encode the information into a
readable Python dictionary. The following table shows the structure of
the state:</p>

<h3>State Encoding of Dou Dizhu<a class="headerlink" href="#state-encoding-of-dou-dizhu" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In Dou Dizhu environment, we encode the state into 6 feature planes. The
size of each plane is 5*15. Each entry of a plane can be either 1 or 0.
The 5 rows represent 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 corresonding cards, respectively. The
15 columns start from “3” to “RJ” (Black Jack). For example, if we have
a “3”, then the entry (1, 0) would be 1, and the rest of column 0 would
be 0. If we have a pair of “4”, then the entry (2, 1) would be 1, and
the rest of column 1 would be 0. Note that the current encoding method
is just an example to show how the feature can be encoded. Users are
encouraged to encode the state for their own purposes by modifying
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">extract_state</span></code> function in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rlcard/envs/doudizhu.py</span></code>. The example

<h3>Action Abstraction of Dou Dizhu<a class="headerlink" href="#action-abstraction-of-dou-dizhu" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The size of the action space of Dou Dizhu is 27472. This number is too
large for learning algorithms. Thus, we make abstractions to the
original action space and obtain 309 actions. We note that some recent
studies also use similar abstraction techniques. The main idea of the
abstraction is to make the kicker fuzzy and only focus on the major part
of the combination. For example, “33344” is abstracted as “333 **”.
When the predicted action of the agent is <strong>not legal</strong>, the agent will
choose “<strong>pass</strong>.”. Thus, the current environment is simple, since once
the agent learns how to play legal actions, it can beat random agents.
Users can also encode the actions for their own purposes (such as
increasing the difficulty of the environment) by modifying
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">decode_action</span></code> function in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rlcard/envs/doudizhu.py</span></code>. Users are also
encouraged to include rule-based agents as opponents. The abstractions
in the environment are as below. The detailed mapping of action and its

<h2>UNO<a class="headerlink" href="#uno" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Uno is an American shedding-type card game that is played with a
specially deck.The game is for 2-10 players. Every player starts with
seven cards, and they are dealt face down. The rest of the cards are
placed in a Draw Pile face down. Next to the pile a space should be
designated for a Discard Pile. The top card should be placed in the
Discard Pile, and the game begins. The first player is normally the
player to the left of the dealer and gameplay usually follows a
clockwise direction. Every player views his/her cards and tries to match
the card in the Discard pile. Players have to match either by the
number, color, or the symbol/action. If the player has no matches, they
must draw a card. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, keep
the card. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get rid
of all the cards in hand. For detailed rules, please refer to
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)">Wikipedia</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unorules.com/">Uno
Rules</a>. And in our toolkit, the number of

<h2>Gin Rummy<a class="headerlink" href="#gin-rummy" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Gin Rummy is a popular two person card game using a regular 52 card deck
(ace being low). The dealer deals 11 cards to his opponent and 10 cards
to himself. Each player tries to form melds of 3+ cards of the same rank
or 3+ cards of the same suit in sequence. If the deadwood count of the
non-melded cards is 10 or less, the player can knock. If all cards can
be melded, the player can gin. Please refer the detail on
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_rummy">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>If a player knocks or gins, the hand ends, each player put down their
melds, and their scores are determined. If a player knocks, the opponent
can layoff some of his deadwood cards if they extend melds of the
knocker. The score is the difference between the two deadwood counts of
the players. If the score is positive, the player going out receives it.
Otherwise, if the score is zero or negative, the opponent has undercut
the player going out and receives the value of the score plus a 25 point
undercut bonus.</p>
<p>The non-dealer discards first (or knocks or gins if he can). If the
player has not knocked or ginned, the next player can pick up the
discard or draw a card from the face down stockpile. He can knock or gin
and the hand ends. Otherwise, he must discard and the next player
continues in the same fashion. If the stockpile is reduced to two cards
only, then the hand is declared dead and no points are scored.</p>

the reward is different from that of the standard game. A player who
gins is awarded 1 point. A player who knocks is awarded 0.2 points. The
losing player is punished by the negative of their deadwood count
divided by 100.</p>

<h2>Bridge<a class="headerlink" href="#bridge" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bridge is a popular four-person card game using a regular 52 card deck (ace being high). The North and South players are partners against the partnership of the East and West players. The dealer deals 13 cards to all four players. There is a round of bidding to determine the contract for the amount of tricks to win by the declarer with a specified trump suit (or no trump). After the bidding concludes, 13 tricks are played to see if the contract is made. During the trick playing, the dummy (the partner of the declarer) exposes his hand for all to see. The declarer plays the cards from the dummy hand.</p>

<h3>Payoff of Bridge<a class="headerlink" href="#payoff-of-bridge" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The payoff is calculated by the terminal state of the game. Note that the payoff is different from that of the standard game.</p>
<p>The payoff for the defender side is the number of tricks taken by the defender side.</p>
<p>The payoff for the declarer side depends upon whether the bid amount of the contract is made or not. If the contract is made (ignoring over tricks), the payoff for the declarer side is the bid amount + 6 + a bonus for making the contract (defaults to 2). If the contract is set, the payoff for the declarer side is the number of under tricks by the declarer side.</p>
<p>This payoff for the defender side encourages them to make as many tricks as possible. Thus, the declarer side will be more likely to be set.</p>
<p>This payoff for the declarer side encourages them to bid as high as possible and to choose the best trump suit or to pass when they have poor hands.</p>
